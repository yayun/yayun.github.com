####Here is some basic command and it's explanation：

Git is a typical representation of distributed version control system.

`$ git init`  # initialized a git repository in /.git

`$ git status ` 

show the working tree status

* if there is nothing in your current working tree it will shows: create/copy files and use "git add" to track
* if you create a file but do nothing it will shows: use 'git add ' to track and include in what will be commited
* if you add file to index these file is ready to commit<!--more-->

`$ git add ./filename` 

* updates index using the current content found in the working tree

<pre  class="pre-color">Yhe file here are in staging area,they are not in our repository yet</pre>


`$ git commit -m "add file to repo"` 

* working tree in stage(index) will write to HEAD (latest revision in a branch or current commit in repo)

Committer: ...Your name and email address were configured automatically based
on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author
    0 files changed
    create mode 100644 fielname

`$ git log`

* view the commit history

`$ git reset --hard HEAD`

`$ git reset HEAD filename`

* If you have already added an changed file, you can use this command to unstage a staged file.It means that you do't add this file

`$ git checkout -- filename`

* Using this command to unmodify a modified file

**If you use Github for your server,here is some command**

`$ git remote add origin git@github.com:yayun/yayun.github.com.git`

 * you can use remote to manage the set of repositories,here you add a repo named 'origin'

 `$ git fetch origin`

 * "origin" is the server name you have added

`$ git  remote`
 
* show which remote servers you have configured

`$ git remote show origin`

* This command shows which branch is automatically pushed when you run git push on certain branches. It also shows you which remote branches on the server you don't yet have, which remote branches you have that have been removed from the server, and multiple branches that are automatically merged when you run git pull.

`$ git remote rm origin`

* remove the server you added

`$ git push -u origin master`

* update remote repo (here name origin) using local repo

`$ git pull origin master`

`$ git clone git@github.com:yayun/yayun.github.com.git`

 **If you want to delete file in your repo in Github**

`$ git rm -r filepath/filename`
<!--如果不小心错误提交  git的相关命令-->
`$ git commit -m "remove file"`
`$ git push -u origin master`

####Version Control

Version control is a  system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. You can also use it to collaborate with other developers.

####Git Branch Management

Git stores data as a series of snapshots.A branch in git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of commits.The default branch name in Git is master. As you initially make commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.

`$git branch`

* show branch you have

`$ git branch new_branch_name`

* Create new branch,this is a new pointer

HEAD is a special pointer that let git konw which branch you are currently on.But if you want to change the branch that HEAD points to,you can use ` git checkout branch_name`

`$ git checkout new_branch_name`

`$ git checkout master`

* points to the default branch

`$ git checkout -D new_branch_name`

* Delete the branch you created

`$ git merge branch_name`

* We can create an branch and do something on this branch,then merge them.

`$ git rebase`
