Linux is a Unix-like computer operating system assemble under the model of free and open source software development development and distribution.So the linux (also called GNU/Linux) os that we called ofen consist of two parts: the linux kernel and some application based on GNU project (GNU packages) and non-GNU programs.The linux kernel:it handles the hardware and devices,and it manages things like memory and peripherals such as monitor, the keyboard and like.Because of its compatibility with Unix,however,the GNU program and <!--more-->untitles were easily ported to the linux kernal.As a result, most systems were comprised of a Linux kernal running modified, or unmodified, GNU utilities, prompting Stallman to dub these systems "GNU/Linux" systems.Though Linux kernel is not part of the GNU project,it was developed using GCC and GNU programming tools.


GNU is a Unix-like computer os developed by GNU project.But what's the difference between GNU and GNU project? Thefirst goal og GNU project is to create a free-software os(GNU)(kernal soft and gnome everthing free).By 1992, theGNU project had completed all of the major operating system components except for their kernel, GNU Hurd. With the release of the Linux kernel, started independently by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and released under the GPL with version 0.12 in 1992, for the first time it was possible to run an operating system composed completely of free software. The GNU system contains all of the official GUN software packages and also includes non-GNU free software,such as TeX and X window System.
