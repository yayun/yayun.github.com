&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hello worldÔºÅ ^^</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first post since I have setted up my blog. My blog is powered by Jekyll-bootstrap which is charming i think.At first I try to use Hyde but gived up for some reasons.Next step I will arrange my previous blog artical to here.And try to write them in english.

My reference:[jekyll-bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/);[if you use hyde](http://hyde.github.io/); [A tutorials for jekyll(also adapted for hyde)](http://www.soimort.org/posts/101/)
