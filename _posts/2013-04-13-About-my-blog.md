&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hello worldÔºÅ ^^</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first post since I have setted up my blog. My blog is powered by Jekyll-bootstrap which is charming i think.I gived up for some reasons after i use Hyde at first.Next step I will arrange my previous blog artical to here.And try to write them in english.
PS: I have almost completely forgotten the konwledge about html/css that I learned before, I should picked it up. 

Some basic command that I would use in Hyde:
<pre class='pre-color'>
$pip install hyde # pip is a python package manager 
$hyde -s /path/to/your/site create
$cd /path/to/your/site
$hyde serve
***than you can access http://localhost:8080 to enter your website 
</pre>

Some basic command that I would use in Hyde:
