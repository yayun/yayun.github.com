This is my first post since I have setted up my blog. My blog is powered by Jekyll-bootstrap which is charming i think.I gived up for some reasons after i use Hyde at first.Next step I will arrange my previous blog artical to here.And try to write them in english.
PS: I have almost completely forgotten the konwledge about html/css that I learned before, I should picked it up. 

**Some basic command that I would use in Hyde:**

    $pip install hyde # pip is a python package manager 
    $hyde -s /path/to/your/site create
    $cd /path/to/your/site
    $hyde serve
than you can access http://localhost:8080 to enter your website
