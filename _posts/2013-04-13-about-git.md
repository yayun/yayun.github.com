####Here is some basic command and it's explanation
 [git](http://git-scm.com/)

`$ git init`  # initialized a git repository in /.git

`$ git status ` 

 # if there is nothing in your current working tree it will shows: create/copy files and use "git add" to track

 # if you create a file but do nothing it will shows: use 'git add ' to track and include in what will be commited
 
 # if you add file to index these file is ready to commit

`$ git add .` # updates index using the current content found in the working tree

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***the file here are in staging area,they are not in our repository yet***


`$ git commit -m "add file to repo"` # working tree in stage(index) will write to HEAD (latest revision in a branch or current commit in repo)

on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

`$ git remote add origin git@github.com:yayun/yayun.github.com.git`

 # you can use remote to manage the set of repositories,here you add a repo named 'origin'

`$ git push -u origin master`

 # update remote repo (here name origin) using local repo

`$ git pull origin master`

`$ git clone git@github.com:yayun/yayun.github.com.git`

`$ git rm -r filepath/filename`
<!--如果不小心错误提交  git的相关命令-->
`$ git commit -m "remove file"`
`$ git push -u origin master`
